A little set of classes designed to help transcribe and play music for the concertina, a folk instrument popularly used in traditional Irish music among other genres. A unique problem for the instrument is it plays different notes depending on the movement of the bellows, so some combinations of notes are impossible to play. Some chords will also have multiple ways they can be played.

Run `python3 test.py` to output a popular ragtimey piece with annotated chords.
